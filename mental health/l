### Initial Code Setup

To begin the development of the Mental Health Companion App, we need to set up the project structure and environment. Below is an example of how to initialize the project:

#### 1. **Project Initialization**
Run the following commands to create a new project directory and initialize a Git repository:

```bash
mkdir mental-health-companion
cd mental-health-companion
git init
```

#### 2. **Set Up a Frontend Framework**
For the frontend, we can use a framework like React. Use the following command to create a React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
```

#### 3. **Set Up a Backend Framework**
For the backend, we can use Node.js with Express. Initialize a Node.js project and install Express:

```bash
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express
```

#### 4. **Directory Structure**
Organize the project with the following structure:

```
mental-health-companion/
├── frontend/
│   └── (React app files)
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js
│   └── (API routes and controllers)
└── README.md
```

#### 5. **Basic Backend Setup**
Create a `server.js` file in the `backend` directory with the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Mental Health Companion API is running');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

#### 6. **Run the Backend Server**
Start the backend server with:

```bash
node backend/server.js
```

This setup provides the foundation for building the app. Next steps include integrating the frontend with the backend and implementing the core features.
